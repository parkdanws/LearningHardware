Notes

Resistors
orange orange brown gold: 330 ohm 
brown black orange gold: 10k ohms

--

light dependent resistor (LDR)
resistance is high in dark. low in light

--

setting up switch:
power (5v) to board. to switch. to 10k resistor AND
digital in. resistor to ground

setting up light:
board output to board. board to long arm of light
light to 330 resistor. resistor to ground.

--

pins 0 - 13: digital i/o
squiggle: analog out
marked analog in pins. (no need to set pinmode)

analog read returns 0 - 1023
analog write has range from 0 - 254
